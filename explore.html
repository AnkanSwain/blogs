    <p class="hcc">in his Seven Lamps of Architecture, published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the "art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them" contributes "to his mental health, power, and pleasure".[13] For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work </p>
